# Configuration

In this section, we will go through the configuration of Faast.

<Callout type="info">
  Please note that the following configuration is just an example and you should
  adjust it to your needs.
</Callout>

```yaml copy filename="config.yaml"
apiVersion: lambdo.io/v1alpha1
kind: Config
api:
  # The host on which the API server will listen
  web_host: 0.0.0.0
  # The port on which the API server will listen
  web_port: 3000
  # The host on which the gRPC server will listen
  grpc_host: 0.0.0.0
  # The port on which the gRPC server will listen
  gprc_port: 50051
  # Bridge name
  bridge: lambdo0
  # The IP address of the bridge
  ip: 10.0.50.0/8
vmm:
  # The kernel path to use for the vmm
  kernel: /var/lib/lambdo/kernel/vmlinux.bin
agent: # NOT IMPLEMENTED
  # The path to the agent binary
  path: /usr/local/bin/lambdo-agent
  # The path to the agent configuration file
  config: /etc/lambdo/agent.yaml
languages:
  # The name of the language runtime
  - name: NODE
    # The version of the node runtime
    version: 12
    # The initramfs to use for the runtime
    initramfs: /var/lib/lambdo/initramfs/node-12.img
    # The steps to run the code
    steps:
      - name: Run the code
        command: /usr/local/bin/node {{filename}}
        # The output configuration
        output:
          # Whether to enable the output
          enabled: true
          # Whether to enable debug output (useful for build steps)
          debug: false
```

## API Configuration

The provided configuration file is structured to define various operational
parameters for Faast. Here's an insightful breakdown of the configuration

### Web Host and Port

`web_host: 0.0.0.0` and `web_port: 3000` specify the host IP and port for the
API server, enabling it to listen for incoming HTTP requests on all available
network interfaces at port 3000.

### gRPC Host and Port

`grpc_host: 0.0.0.0` and `gprc_port: 50051` set the host IP and port for the
gRPC server, facilitating it to listen for gRPC requests on all available
network interfaces at port 50051.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You should not change the gRPC port unless you know what you are doing.
</Callout>

### Bridge Configuration

`bridge: lambdo0` and `ip: 10.0.50.0/8` designate the name and IP address for
the network bridge, which is instrumental in network communications within the
Faast ecosystem.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You should not change the bridge name and IP address unless you know what you
  are doing.
</Callout>

## VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) Configuration

`kernel: /var/lib/lambdo/kernel/vmlinux.bin` stipulates the path to the Linux
kernel binary that will be utilized by the VMM.

## Language Runtime Configuration

The configuration for a Node.js runtime is specified with a name `name: NODE`,
version `version: 12`, and the path to the respective initramfs
`initramfs: /var/lib/lambdo/initramfs/node-12.img`.
