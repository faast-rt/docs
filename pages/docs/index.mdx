# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of Faast, a cutting-edge Function as a Service
(FaaS) server designed to maximize efficiency. Developed in the Rust programming
language, known for its performance and safety, Faast embodies a remarkable
blend of robustness and agility, essential in modern serverless architectures.

A unique aspect of Faast is its tailored execution environment. The system
utilizes an initramfs and a bespoke Linux kernel, each constructed expressly for
Faast's operational requirements. The initramfs contains a specialized SDK of
the language in use (e.g., Node) and an agent that facilitates GRPC
communication between the virtual machine and the API. In contrast, the Linux
kernel operates with an initramfs and employs the newc compression format,
optimizing the system's performance.

Through these meticulously engineered components and environments, Faast
transcends conventional FaaS offerings, providing a high-performance, reliable,
and extensible platform capable of meeting the demanding needs of contemporary
serverless computing landscapes.

## Features

- The utilization of a custom initramfs and Linux kernel, along with
  language-specific SDKs, ensures optimized performance and communication
  between the VM and the API.
- Faast dynamically receives and executes function code via API without
  retaining the function, ensuring lightweight operation and real-time code
  execution.
- Faast enables streamlined virtual machine launch and management, enhancing the
  efficiency of function execution.
- Faast offers a robust and high-speed platform suitable for high-demand
  serverless computing scenarios.
- The use of GRPC for communication between the VM and the API provides a
  modern, protocol-buffer based method for ensuring efficient, robust, and
  secure inter-component communication.
